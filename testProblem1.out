 1) Creating new string list with following sentence:
	This is a long sentence
	with more than 10 words.	
	1st word is "This"
 2) List has 14 strings and 67 chars
 3) Number of strings returned by strListFromWords is identical to number returned by numStrsInList
 4) The sentence string itself is a "list" with 1 string and 71 chars

 5) Applying nextStrInList iteratively on string list...
     String no.  1 in list is 'This'
     String no.  2 in list is 'is'
     String no.  3 in list is 'a'
     String no.  4 in list is 'long'
     String no.  5 in list is 'sentence'
     String no.  6 in list is 'with'
     String no.  7 in list is 'more'
     String no.  8 in list is 'than'
     String no.  9 in list is '10'
     String no. 10 in list is 'words.'
     String no. 11 in list is '1st'
     String no. 12 in list is 'word'
     String no. 13 in list is 'is'
     String no. 14 in list is '"This"'
 6) Applying nextStrInList one more time yields NULL

 7) Resetting nextStrInList using NULL list.
 8) Applying nextStrInList iteratively again, but doing this a bit differently (with differernt outcome)...
     Next string is 'This'
     Next string is 'is'
     Next string is 'is'
     Next string is 'a'
     Next string is 'a'
     Next string is 'long'
     Next string is 'long'
     Next string is 'sentence'
     Next string is 'sentence'
     Next string is 'with'
     Next string is 'with'
     Next string is 'more'
     Next string is 'more'
     Next string is 'than'
     Next string is 'than'
     Next string is '10'
     Next string is '10'
     Next string is 'words.'
     Next string is 'words.'
     Next string is '1st'
     Next string is '1st'
     Next string is 'word'
     Next string is 'word'
     Next string is 'is'
     Next string is 'is'
     Next string is '"This"'
     Next string is '"This"'

 9) writing new list with string = 'Hello world !'
10) List has 3 strings and 13 chars
11) Number of strings returned by strListFromWords is identical to number returned by numStrsInList
12) creating list2 with string = 'Hello world !'
13) List2 has 3 strings and 13 chars

14) Applying nextStrInList on list2 produces 1st word: 'Hello'
15) Applying nextStrInList on list produces 1st word (different list): 'Hello'
16) Applying nextStrInList on list once more produces 2nd word:        'world'

17) Freeing list2
18) Emptying list
18) Emptied list has 0 strings and 0 chars

18) Applying nextString on list (now empty) produces an odd result: !
Done.
